Welcome! This is the official and main repository of BoneOS. This project is currently in high development, as we are working on getting the basic setup sorted out. Later on, we will start developing multitude of features. We have converted the project from C++ to C. This Operating System is predominately written in C, but there are parts (like hardware communication, scripting, building, etc ...) which will use other common languages. If you find any issue using this OS please request an issue [**here**](https://meta.boneos.org/)! If you have any contributions or pull requests, which will be highly appreciated, please issue a pull request [**here**](https://github.com/Bone-Project/BoneOS/pulls)!

# Installation
---

There are two ways to install BoneOS: one for the normal user to get it into his Virtual Machine and the other for the developer who want to contribute (building from source). Finally, there is a better way for developers and thatâ€™s to get Floobits.

#### Normal Installation (For user)
  First download the ISO from this repository by either downloading the zip and extracting it, or by cloning it using git. Next, plug it into your Virtual Machine. [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjlaEAzUZo&feature=youtu.be) is a video showing how to do this using VirtualBox as the Virtual Machine Emulator. You can download Virtual Box [**here**](https://www.virtualbox.org/). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDiwl6AxNrc&feature=youtu.be) is a video showing how to get it in VMWare. VMWare is paid , there if a free trial though. You can get more Information at our Offical Download Page [here](https://boneos.org/download.html). 
 
#### Building From Source (For developer)

 First make sure you have a Ubuntu Terminal (If you are on Windows, use the new Linux Subsystem Feature). Then download the dependencies using `sh setup.sh`. Then install the cross compiler using `make c_compiler`. Next, set the cross compiler in your environment variables `cd cross` and then `. ./setenv.sh`. Finally, run the following commands:
 ```
 cd ../ # Get Back to Root Directory
 make
 ```
 That should set you up with the development environment.
 
#### More Info(For Developer)
