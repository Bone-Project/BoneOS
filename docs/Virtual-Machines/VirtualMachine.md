###Virtual Machines

You can run BoneOS either directly on the hardware or using a [virtual machine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) Virtual Machines are more convenient as after you have finished running the OS you wanted to run, switching back to your main OS does not take time; you only need to close a window.

You can run BoneOS in these virtual machines:

 - QEmu
 - Virtual Box
 - VM Ware
