###Virtual Box

**WARNINGS**

 - Installing Virtual Box on a Linux Distribution **can lead to serious problems** [like this](http://askubuntu.com/questions/17381/unity-doesnt-load-no-launcher-no-dash-appears) (I have faced them on my Ubuntu 14.04 after installing Virtual Box, which I no longer use). It is recommended that you use QEmu if you are on a Linux Distribution.

If you are using a Ubuntu/Debian based distribution, run the command:

    sudo apt-get install virtualbox
    
to install virtualbox in your computer. To see if it has been installed successfully, run the command

    virtualbox
    
which _should_ open Virtual Box in a new window. If that does not happen, there has been an error, so please request an issue on our Github repository with all the necessary details to reproduce the problem.
