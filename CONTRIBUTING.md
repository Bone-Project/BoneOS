# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

- [Contributing code](#code)
- [Reporting issues](#issues)

## Code

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

2. Start coding!
    - Follow the [code style](https://github.com/Bone-Project/BoneOS/blob/master/CODESTYLE.md) guidelines.
    - Check your code works as expected and document any changes.

3. Commit & [push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) your changes to a new branch (not `master`, one change per branch)
    - Commit messages should:
        - Use the present tense
        - Have a title which begins with a capital letter
        - Be descriptive. (e.g. no `Update main.c` or `Fix a problem`)

4. Once you are happy with your changes, submit a pull request.
     - Open the [pull-request form](https://github.com/Bone-Project/BoneOS/pull/new/master).
     - Add a short description explaining briefly what you've done (or if it's a work-in-progress - what you need to do).

##### A pull-request is considered merge-able when:

1. It works.
2. It follows the code style.

## Issues

If you experience an issue, we would like to know the details.

1. Do a quick search on GitHub to check if the issue has already been reported.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/Bone-Project/BoneOS/issues/new) and describe the issue you are having - you could include:
     - Screenshots
     - Ways you have tried to solve the issue, and whether they worked or not
     - Your BoneOS version

After reporting you should aim to answer questions or clarifications as this helps pinpoint the cause of the issue (if you don't do this your issue may be closed).
